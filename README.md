##### A Patient's medical history.
Med-Rec is a user-friendly platform for doctors to update and access a patient's medical history.

#### Why do we need medical history?
A number of diseases can be identified by observing **patterns of previous diseases and medications**. 

### The Problem
* Doctors do not have access to medical history.
* In developed countries, doctors keep digital records but these records aren't inter-connected.
* There's no standard format for keeping these records.

### Why Med-Rec?
* **User-friendly** platform to track patient's medical history
* **Standard format** for all users ( doctors ).
* **Data privacy** of users. Only authorized doctors can access medical records.
* **Authenticate Doctors** using their license number.
> future scope: Patient will receive an **OTP** when a doctor wants to access the medical record.
